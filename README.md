# TadpoleMicrobiomes

This study looks at the evolution of oophagy (egg-feeding) in the poison frog Ranitomeya imitator. We examine both gene expression and the microbiome in tadpole intestines from two congeneric species that are either facultative omnivores (Ranitomeya variabilis) or have evolved oophagy (Ranitomeya imitator).
