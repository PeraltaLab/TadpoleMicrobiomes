We suggest that careful distinction
between the mode of action (transport vs. process)
and the timescale of activity (ephemeral to permanent)
results in at least four very different
mechanisms by which a landscape patch might
have a disproportionate effect on landscape or
ecosystem scale budgets.

1. PERMANENT CONTROL POINTS are landscape
patches where continuous delivery of reactants
and nearly constant appropriate environmental
conditions allow for sustained high rates of
biogeochemical activity relative to the surrounding
landscape. The hydrologically connected
flowpaths running through riparian
zones and hyporheic zones are well-established
examples of permanent control points within
landscapes (Peterjohn and Correll 1984; Hedin
and others 1998; Triska and others 1993).

2. ACTIVATED CONTROL POINTS are landscape
patches that support high transformation rates
only when the delivery rate of one or more
limiting reactants increases and when abiotic
conditions required for a particular biogeochemical
process are optimized. For example,
organic matter oxidation is constrained in many
areas of the landscape (for example, low-lying
topographic positions) by oxygen supply; denitrification
in these same areas may be constrained
by low delivery of nitrate. Events that
provide one or more limiting resources or conditions
can initiate high activity rates in these
locations (Jenerette and others 2008; Harms and
Grimm 2012).

3. EXPORT CONTROL POINTS are landscape patches
in which reactants accumulate until a hydraulic
gradient or diffusion threshold is
overcome, allowing for export. It is important to
note that these areas could have very low in situ
rates of transformation accompanied by efficient
retention, or they may be permanent or activated
control points in which the products of high biogeochemical
reaction rates accumulate over
time until conditions allow for their export. For
example, the consequences of an export control
point were infamously observed at Lake Nyos
when accumulating deep water CO2 reached
sufficiently high concentrations to explosively
degas, leading to mass suffocation (Kling and
others 1987). Less dramatic but far more commonly
encountered examples are the high rates
of DOC export during storms as DOC that has
accumulated in upslope portions of the landscape
is transported to receiving streams (for
example, Boyer and others 1997, 2000).

4. TRANSPORT CONTROL POINTS are landscape
patches that have exceptionally high transport
capacity for water and gases and thereby contribute
disproportionately to the movement and
losses of biogeochemically important elements
without themselves possessing high activity
rates. Transport control points can also potentially
mask nearby permanent control points by quickly
and efficiently removing product from the site of
processing, leading to low concentrations or
pools of the product in situ. Macropore flow
paths are a classic example of a transport control
point within many soils (Bundt and others
2001). In the Anthropocene, stormwater pipes
and tile drains are designed examples of transport
control points found throughout urban and agricultural
landscapes.



Because of fleeting environmental changes
within hyporheic zones, we hypothesize that hyporheic zone
microbiomes may exhibit more phenotypic plasticity than more stable
ecosystems, meriting further investigation as we explore spatiotemporal
dynamics across multiple systems (Fodelianakis et al., 2017).

et al.,2012; Nemergutetal.,2013), phenotypicplasticity
